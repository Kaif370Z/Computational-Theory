## Countdown Numbers Game  By Kaif Tahir

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Python solution for the popular "Countdown" television show segment, known as the "Countdown numbers game." Players must use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division mathematical operations within a time limit in order to reach a randomly generated target number. Initially, six arbitrary numbers are used. This solver uses a range of computational strategies to try and automate the solution process, with a focus on brute force and dynamic programming techniques.
